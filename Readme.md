# ChatGPT, Mistral, & Gemma Q&A Streamlit App

This [Streamlit app](https://chatbot-docs.streamlit.app/) 
allows users to upload text articles and ask questions about the content of these articles. 
It utilizes commercial **OpenAI's GPT** model alongside the innovative open-source **Mistral** and **Gemma** models to generate answers, offering an enriched interactive way to explore information within documents.

## Features

- Upload text or markdown files and ask the app to answer questions based on the content.
- Utilizes advanced language models for comprehensive understanding, summarizing complex documents, and generating empathetic and engaging responses.
- Secure input for OpenAI API keys with a sidebar widget.
- Interactive questioning with enabled/disabled state based on file upload status.

## How to Use

- Deployed App (Limited Functionality)

**For using ChatGPT:** Get an OpenAI API Key. If you do not already have one, obtain an OpenAI API key by [creating an account here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

- Local APP (Advanced Functionality):

If you have a cuda-compatible GPU (for example, I used  [HP Zbook Fury G8](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/mobile-workstation-pc.html) with GPU RTX A5000 16GB),
you should be able to run the full set of models including 
[Mistral](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) and 
[Gemma](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/), 
the most recent ones, state of the art models. It will work much faster than here.
